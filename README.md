# NovelBuilderAI -- HQ Writing Tool
Use AI (Anthropic's Claude) to generate HIGH QUALITY novel world background & characters & story plots from the ground up (it does not write the prose)

Warning: **it costs one dollar** to generate all of the cells. The quality though, is unmatched. It is State-of-the-art technology. 

There is no way around that. I am giving the code for free but the AI, it is not in my hands.

Examples are worth a thousand words:


**The novel about Vesper, a winged diplomat**

**The novel about Lysandra, a young druidess**

I wrote none of it. I just launched the program with its empty cells, and clicked Submit. 

One minute later, I have all this information. 

**How to install**:
1) Install Python
   
2) Run the console commands:
   - pip install PyQt5
   - pip install anthropic
     
3) Create an API key at
   https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   
4) Edit the top of the file NovelBuilderAI.py with your API key, where it is specified

5) Run the command
   python ./NovelBuilderAI.py


**How to use**:
- Click Submit to generate all the cells which have been checked
- Always check & run the cells in order (top to bottom, then left to right), otherwise it will be inconsistent
- When you check a cell to change, you should have to check all of the following cells so that it stays consistent
- You can read the generated text in the black console window, and the GUI will only update once it is all done (give it one minute or two)
- When you are happy with the results, copy/paste the files which have been generated for you in the folder

If you don't back them up, they will be overwritten with the next generation.

Enjoy
